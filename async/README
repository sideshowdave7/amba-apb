Asynchronous AMBA-APB Bus Design


Tools used:
3D (Available of University of Utah CADE machines)
Artisan 180nm academic VLSI library
Cadence synthesis


Directories:

3d: Contains all 3d generated files
report: Contains all area/power results
synth: Contains all synthesis generated files


hdl: Contains all the following mapped source files:

APB_MASTER_ASYNC.v: Asyncronhous FSM mapped onto Artisan 180nm academic gate library.
APB_SLAVE_ASYNC.v:  Synchronous (simulation-only) design for simulating correctness of APB_MASTER afsm.
APB_TOP.v: Sample top level design for Async BUS
APB_tb.v : Simulation stimulus.



apg-master-async.data: This is the specification used as input for the 3D burst-mode state machine tool.
